### Web Application made using React

Current functionalities:
- CRUD operations - add, deleting and updating a cat entity
- Sorting by name or age
- Filtering by name
- Showing cats by age groups (kittens/adult cats/senior cats)
- Dynamic Pagination
- Displaying cat details in a detail window
- Starting a cat generation thread which perpetually adds cats to the list, generated using faker and [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/)
- Statistics chart of the cats' age categories
- CRUD operations and filtering + sorting now works in the backend
- Page switches between local data and backend depending if the backend server is up or down, and if an internet connection exists
- Added infinite scrolling functionality, elements load in the page 9 at a time with a small delay
