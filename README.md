### Web application made using react

The app currently supports CRUD operations - add, deleting and updating a cat entity.
Other functionalities:
- Sorting by name or age
- Filtering by name
- Showing cats by age groups (kittens/adult cats/senior cats)
- Dynamic Pagination
- Displaying cat details in a detail window
- Starting a cat generation thread which perpetually adds cats to the list, generated using faker and [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/)
- Statistics chart of the cats' age categories
